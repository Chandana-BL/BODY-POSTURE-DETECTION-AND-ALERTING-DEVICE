# BODY-POSTURE-DETECTION-AND-ALERTING-DEVIC

## Body Posture Detection and Correction Device

This project aims to create a body posture detection and alerting device using an ESP32 microcontroller, 
MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, OLED display, and a vibration motor. The device alerts the user with 
a vibration when poor posture is detected and displays the posture status on the OLED screen using graphics.

## Components Used for the device

- ESP32-WROOM-32
- MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope
- 1.3" OLED Display
- Vibration Motor
- LiPo Battery
- Resistor (220 Ohms)
- Connecting Wires

## Installation for the project

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Board Package
- Adafruit MPU6050 Library
- u8g2 Library
- Adafruit GFX Library

### Steps

1. Install the ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE.
2. Install the required libraries from the Library Manager.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/body-posture-detection.git
cd body-posture-detection
```

4. Open the `body_posture_detection.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
5. Select the correct board and port.
6. Upload the code to the ESP32.

### Header File

[Code File] bitmapheader.h


### Explanation

- The `setup` function initializes the MPU6050 and OLED display.
- The `loop` function continuously reads the accelerometer data and checks for poor posture.
- If poor posture is detected, the vibration motor is activated and a message is displayed on the OLED screen.

## Usage

- Power the device with the LiPo battery.
- Attach the device to your body.
- The device will monitor your posture and alert you with a vibration if poor posture is detected.
